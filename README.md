Recipe web pages
This is The Odin Project (TOP) recipe website project. It will be a small collection of web pages to showcase what I have learned so far through TOP in HTML and related technologies. I plan to revisit this project and embellish as more is learned.

Through the Odin Project I have been introduced to HTML, VSCode, Git, and GitHub. To date I have completed 42% of The Odin Projects' 'Foundations Course'.
